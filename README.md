YouTube Transcript Summarizer
This project uses HuggingFaceâ€™s Transformers library in Python to perform abstractive text summarization on YouTube video transcripts fetched via the YouTube Transcript API.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
HuggingFace Transformers

YouTube Transcript API

Python (Core scripting)

ðŸ§  What It Does
Retrieves a videoâ€™s transcript using the YouTube API.

Applies abstractive summarization using a pretrained transformer model.

Outputs a human-like summary thatâ€™s concise and restructured â€” not just extracted snippets.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Approach?
While the problem can be solved in several ways, this implementation avoids:

Converting video to audio and using ASR (which is resource-heavy and slow for long videos).

Raw subtitle parsing, which requires additional effort to clean and restructure into coherent text.

By working directly with the YouTube transcript and applying NLP-based summarization, this solution is both efficient and lightweight.
